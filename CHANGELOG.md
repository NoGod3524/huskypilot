# Changelog

Every notable change to HuskyPilot, oldest first. Each entry corresponds to a
merged pull request, and each version tag marks the state of `main` right after
that merge.

The scheme is deliberately simple:

- **Patch** (`0.1.x`, `0.2.x`, `1.0.x`) — a fix, a cleanup, documentation, or a small addition.
- **Minor** (`0.2.0`, `0.3.0`, `1.1.0`) — a new capability, or a change to the architecture.

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/NoGod3524/huskypilot/releases/tag/v1.1.0) — Any calendar, several of them

*Minor bump: 1.0.1 assumed a calendar feed belongs to one course. HuskyCT issues
one feed per course, so a semester is several links — and the graded items inside
a feed never say which course they came from. Finding those links at all was the
real barrier, so 1.1.0 removes it.*

### Added

- **Import a downloaded `.ics` file** — drop it anywhere on the page, or choose
  it from disk, several at once. Every calendar system can hand out a file, so
  this is the one route that works identically everywhere: no buried setting to
  find, no link to copy. ([#22])
- The import card now **leads with that file route** and states the three steps
  to get the file. The link form, the opt-in memory and the course naming are
  folded away behind one click each, so the first screen is one job, not six.
- A **course list** on the import page. Add each course once — a code plus
  LEC / DIS / LAB / SEM — and mark one as the default. ([#22])
- A **per-task course picker** on the Plan and Tasks rows, for the rows the
  default gets wrong. An explicit "show no course" is available too. ([#22])
- **Several calendars at once.** Adding a second course used to replace the
  first; feeds are now a list you can add to, up to eight. ([#22])
- Every imported calendar is **filed under a course**, so its rows are labelled
  without any per-row work, and can be **refreshed or removed on its own**.
- Rows named by the feed itself still win over the default, so a feed that does
  carry a course name is never overridden by a guess.
- A file import is named after **the file**, not the feed: five Blackboard
  exports all call themselves "University of Connecticut".

### Changed

- The README now says where to get a feed on Blackboard, Canvas, Moodle, Google
  Classroom and Google Calendar, and the app no longer presents HuskyCT as the
  only way in.
- The 1.0.x single saved import and its remembered URL are upgraded into one
  entry in the calendar list, and the 1.0.1 single course label into a one-course
  list, so nobody loses what they had already set.
- Deleting the default course hands the default to the next course in the list,
  rather than blanking every row that relied on it.
- Remembering a link is now a preference that applies to the links you add next,
  rather than a property of the one calendar the app used to hold.

### Fixed

- Tasks are de-duplicated by their ICS UID, so overlapping feeds — or a feed that
  is simply refreshed — no longer double their rows.

## [1.0.1](https://github.com/NoGod3524/huskypilot/releases/tag/v1.0.1) — Rows you can actually recognise

*Patch: the Plan route used to print `CALENDAR — Take-home Quiz 1` and nothing
else. It now says which course the row belongs to, what kind of entry it is, and
exactly when and where it happens.*

### Added

- A **course label** on the import page: name the feed once — a code plus
  LEC / DIS / LAB / SEM — and every imported row carries it. A Blackboard export
  contains no course name at all, so the only person who can supply one is the
  person who subscribed to the feed. ([#21])
- A **kind badge** on Plan and Tasks rows, *Class* or *Assignment*, read from the
  Blackboard UID — the only field in the feed that distinguishes the two. ([#21])
- Plan rows now show the **exact due moment** (`Fri, Sep 11, 12:30 PM`) and the
  **room**, so a row is no longer just a relative "in 3 days".

### Fixed

- Typing a space into the course code no longer swallows it. The label is saved
  on every keystroke, so `NRE 1000E` used to collapse into `NRE1000E`.

### Removed

- The `CALENDAR` placeholder that appeared on every task with no course of its
  own. A row now shows nothing rather than something untrue.

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/NoGod3524/huskypilot/releases/tag/v1.0.0) — Plan

*First stable release. HuskyPilot stops only showing what is due and starts
saying what to work on next.*

### Added

- A **Plan** route (`/plan`) that compares how much work each deadline needs with
  the days remaining. ([#20])
- **Effort estimates** per task — quick (15 min), medium (45), long (90) — set
  with one click and kept in the browser.
- **At-risk detection**: a task is flagged when the sittings it still needs
  exceed the days available, so "start now" becomes visible before it is too
  late. One sitting is 30 focused minutes.
- **Overdue surfacing**: deadlines that already passed and are still unticked now
  have a home, instead of quietly dropping out of the week view.
- A suggested focus total for today, counting the overdue and at-risk work.

### Changed

- `dueTimestamp` moved from `reminders` into `date-utils`, beside the other date
  helpers.

## [0.3.1](https://github.com/NoGod3524/huskypilot/releases/tag/v0.3.1) — Version footer and settled history

### Added

- A version footer on every route, read from `package.json` so the version has a
  single source of truth. ([#18])
- This changelog, plus annotated git tags marking every earlier release. ([#17])

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/NoGod3524/huskypilot/releases/tag/v0.3.0) — Real routes

*Minor bump: architecture.*

### Changed

- Replaced the single 1024-line dashboard component with a shared state provider,
  a persistent app shell, and five focused section components.
- Calendar state now lives in the root layout, so moving between routes keeps the
  imported tasks, completion state, language, and reminder settings — with no
  flash of demo data and no repeated auto-refresh request.

### Added

- Real routes, each with its own title: `/` (overview), `/tasks`, `/calendar`, and
  `/insights`. ([#16])
- Sidebar navigation uses `next/link` and marks the active route with
  `aria-current="page"`.

## [0.2.3](https://github.com/NoGod3524/huskypilot/releases/tag/v0.2.3) — Auto-refresh and CSV export

### Added

- Opt-in auto-refresh from a remembered calendar URL. It is off by default, the
  URL is kept in this browser only, and it is removed by unticking the box or
  pressing **Clear saved data**. ([#14])
- CSV export of everything currently on screen, with a UTF-8 byte-order mark so
  Excel reads Chinese text correctly. ([#15])

### Changed

- The privacy wording now says the ICS URL is not stored *unless you explicitly
  ask for it*.

## [0.2.2](https://github.com/NoGod3524/huskypilot/releases/tag/v0.2.2) — Documentation refresh

### Changed

- Both READMEs now document the PWA, reminders, insights, and the optional
  auto-refresh, and the project structure and roadmap are up to date. ([#13])

## [0.2.1](https://github.com/NoGod3524/huskypilot/releases/tag/v0.2.1) — Due-soon reminders

### Added

- A due-soon banner for anything due in the next 24 hours. ([#12])
- Opt-in browser notifications while the app is open, de-duplicated by a task
  fingerprint so the same reminder is never repeated.
- A service worker `notificationclick` handler that brings the open app forward.

## [0.2.0](https://github.com/NoGod3524/huskypilot/releases/tag/v0.2.0) — Installable and offline

*Minor bump: new capability.*

### Added

- A web app manifest, PWA icons, and a theme colour, so HuskyPilot can be added
  to a phone's home screen and opened full screen. ([#11])
- A service worker that caches the app shell: navigations are network-first (so a
  new deploy lands immediately), hashed assets are cache-first, and the import API
  is never cached.
- Safe-area padding so the layout clears the home indicator when installed.

## [0.1.10](https://github.com/NoGod3524/huskypilot/releases/tag/v0.1.10) — Import help

### Added

- An expandable "Where do I find my ICS link?" section on the import card. ([#10])

## [0.1.9](https://github.com/NoGod3524/huskypilot/releases/tag/v0.1.9) — Repository cleanup

### Added

- A secrets audit of the working tree and the full git history before the
  repository was made public.

### Removed

- The assistant prompt file and editor/assistant scaffolding, so the repository
  root only contains project files. ([#9])

## [0.1.8](https://github.com/NoGod3524/huskypilot/releases/tag/v0.1.8) — Continuous integration

### Added

- GitHub Actions running `test`, `lint`, and `build` on every pull request and
  every push to `main`, with least-privilege permissions and concurrency
  cancellation. ([#8])

## [0.1.7](https://github.com/NoGod3524/huskypilot/releases/tag/v0.1.7) — Insights panel

### Added

- A workload analytics section: completion rate, tasks per course, the next 7
  days, and the next 4 weeks. ([#7])

## [0.1.6](https://github.com/NoGod3524/huskypilot/releases/tag/v0.1.6) — Portfolio README

### Added

- A bilingual README (English and Simplified Chinese) with an architecture
  diagram, the SSRF control table, and the design decisions. ([#6])

## [0.1.5](https://github.com/NoGod3524/huskypilot/releases/tag/v0.1.5) — Obsolete panel removed

### Removed

- The outdated "Private by design" panel. ([#5])

## [0.1.4](https://github.com/NoGod3524/huskypilot/releases/tag/v0.1.4) — Dead navigation removed

### Removed

- Sidebar links that pointed at nothing ("Courses" and "Privacy"). ([#4])

## [0.1.3](https://github.com/NoGod3524/huskypilot/releases/tag/v0.1.3) — English / 简体中文

### Added

- A language toggle for the whole interface, including date formatting, remembered
  across visits. ([#3])

## [0.1.2](https://github.com/NoGod3524/huskypilot/releases/tag/v0.1.2) — Task completion

### Added

- A checkbox on every task card, a struck-through title when done, and state that
  survives a refresh and a re-import. ([#2])

## [0.1.1](https://github.com/NoGod3524/huskypilot/releases/tag/v0.1.1) — Local persistence

### Added

- Imported events and their metadata are saved in the browser and restored on
  load, using versioned payloads that recover safely from corrupt data. ([#1])

## [0.1.0](https://github.com/NoGod3524/huskypilot/releases/tag/v0.1.0) — HuskyPilot V0

### Added

- The first working version: paste a HuskyCT / Blackboard ICS link and get the
  next 7 days grouped into Today / Tomorrow / This week.
- An SSRF-hardened server-side download (`safe-fetch.ts`), ICS parsing with
  `node-ical`, and course-name extraction from event titles.
- A `node:test` suite covering parsing, grouping, and URL rejection.
